  New and Updated Features

     • The 'console.log.level' preference was removed in Wireshark
       3.6.0. This release adds an '-o console.log.level:'
       backward-compatibilty option on the CLI that maps to the new
       logging sub-system. Note that this does not have bitmask
       semantics and does not correspond to any actual preference. It is
       just a transition mechanism for users that were relying on this
       CLI option and will be removed in the future. To see the new
       diagnostic output options consult the manpages or the output of
       '--help'.

   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can

  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders or tshark -G folders to find the default locations
  on your system.
