   IOGraph automatically adds a graph for the selected display filter if
   no previous graph exists

   Action buttons for the display filter bar may be aligned left via the

       Display filter Expression …​" as well as to the context menu of
       the display filter toolbar

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.0.0:

     • You can drag and drop a field to a column header to create a
       column for that field, or to the display filter input to create a
       display filter. If a display filter is applied, the new filter
       can be added using the same rules as “Apply Filter”

     • You can drag and drop a column entry to the display filter to
       create a filter for it.

     • You can import profiles from a .zip archive or an existing
       directory.

     • Dark mode support on macOS and dark theme support on other
       platforms has been improved.

     • Brotli decompression support in HTTP/HTTP2 (requires the brotli
       library).

     • The build system now checks for a SpeexDSP system library
       installation. The bundled Speex resampler code is still provided
       as a fallback.

     • WireGuard decryption can now be enabled through keys embedded in
       a pcapng in addition to the existing key log preference (Bug
       15571[1]).

     • A new tap for extracting credentials from the capture file has
       been added. It can be accessed through the -z credentials option
       in tshark or from the “Tools › Credentials” menu in Wireshark.

     • Editcap can now split files on floating point intervals.

     • Windows .msi packages are now signed using SHA-2[2]. .exe
       installers are still dual-signed using SHA-1 and SHA-2.

     • The “Enabled Protocols” Dialog now only enables, disables and
       inverts protocols based on the set filter selection. The protocol
       type (standard or heuristic) may also be choosen as a filter
       value.

     • Save RTP stream to .au supports any codec with 8000 Hz rate
       supported by Wireshark (shown in RTP player). If save of audio is
       not possible (unsupported codec or rate), silence of same length
       is saved and warning is shown.

     • The “Analyze › Apply as Filter” and “Analyze › Prepare a Filter”
       packet list and detail popup menus now show a preview of their
       respective filters.

     • Protobuf files (*.proto) can now be configured to enable more
       precise parsing of serialized Protobuf data (such as gRPC).

     • HTTP2 support streaming mode reassembly. To use this feature,
       subdissectors can register itself to "streaming_content_type"
       dissector table and return pinfo→desegment_len and
       pinfo→desegment_offset to tell HTTP2 when to start and how many
       additional bytes requires when next called.

     • The message of stream gRPC method can now be parsed with
       supporting of HTTP2 streaming mode reassembly feature.

     • The Wireshark 3.1.0 Windows installers ship with Qt 5.12.4.
       Previous installers shipped with Qt 5.12.1.
