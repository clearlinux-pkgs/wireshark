Wireshark 2.9.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 3.0.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Many user interface improvements have been made. See the “New and
  Updated Features” section below for more details.

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

   Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes. (Bug 1419[1])

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 2.6.0:

     • The Windows .exe installers now ship with Npcap instead of
       WinPcap.

     • Conversation timestamps are supported for UDP/UDP-Lite protocols

     • TShark now supports the -G elastic-mapping option which generates
       an ElasticSearch mapping file.

     • The “Capture Information” dialog has been added back (Bug
       12004[2]).

     • The Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 dissectors no longer validate the
       frame check sequence (checksum) by default.

     • The TCP dissector gained a new “Reassemble out-of-order segments”
       preference to fix dissection and decryption issues in case TCP
       segments are received out-of-order. See the User’s Guide, chapter
       TCP Reassembly for details.

     • Decryption support for the new WireGuard dissector (Bug 15011[3],
       requires Libgcrypt 1.8).

     • The BOOTP dissector has been renamed to DHCP. With the exception
       of “bootp.dhcp”, the old “bootp.*” display filter fields are
       still supported but may be removed in a future release.

     • The SSL dissector has been renamed to TLS. As with BOOTP the old
       “ssl.*” display filter fields are supported but may be removed in
       a future release.

     • Coloring rules, IO graphs, Filter Buttons and protocol preference
       tables can now be copied from other profiles using a button in
       the corresponding configuration dialogs.

     • APT-X has been renamed to aptX.

     • When importing from hex dump, it’s now possible to add an
       ExportPDU header with a payload name. This calls the specific
       dissector directly without lower protocols.

     • The sshdump and ciscodump extcap interfaces can now use a proxy
       for the SSH connection.

     • Dumpcap now supports the -a packets:NUM and -b packets:NUM
       options.

     • Wireshark now includes a “No Reassembly” configuration profile.

     • Wireshark now supports the Russian language.

     • The build system now supports AppImage packages.

     • The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.12.0. Previously they
       shipped with Qt 5.9.7.

  Removed Features and Support

     • The legacy (GTK+) user interface has been removed and is no
       longer supported.

     • Wireshark requires Qt 5.2 or later. Qt 4 is no longer supported.

     • Wireshark requires GLib 2.32 or later.

     • Building Wireshark requires CMake. Autotools is no longer
       supported.

     • TShark’s -z compare option was removed.

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
  https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[4].

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[5] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to
  find the default locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/[6]

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[7] and on the
  wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information and archives
  for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found on the web site[8].

  Bugs and feature requests can be reported on the bug tracker[9].

  Official Wireshark training and certification are available from
  Wireshark University[10].

 Frequently Asked Questions

  A complete FAQ is available on the Wireshark web site[11].
